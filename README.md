# Gawkbox_assignment
Built a simple front end interface using React Native, coupled with a GoLang backend API that will allow us to search for users that are live streaming on Twitch at the time of search, and when clicking that result, you can view their live stream. 

Product Requirements:
● I should be able to run a search for any currently live creators 
● I should be able to click on 1 result from the search's result set and see the live stream 
● Front end must call the GoLang API for this information
